Hello Again Terrific Team; @student awesome news👑 🚀 Flipgrid Assignments have just started👏 💪 🥳

Flipgrid assignments are designed to prepare you for the interviews with the most frequently asked interview questions.

📌  Every week, on Mondays, I will share a different question with you and you will study/review the topic, make preparation/notes for it and record yourself as if you are asked this question in a real interview (you will pretend it/role-playing)

📌  Every week; the due time is Sunday Midnight EST (system will not let you submit if the due time passes, just like quizzes)😱

📌  You have to record yourself within the announced time limit of recording duration for each Question (for example 1st Q is under 3 minutes of recording, otherwise the system will not let you submit it)

📌  I will pin that week's question and update the pin every week 🍀

📌  The link will not change until the end; this is our group's flipgrid dashboard and every week a new question will be revealed. You will submit your answers to those new week's questions accordingly:📢 📢 📢 🥇 🏆 🎯

📌 Your submissions will be available to only your group (no other groups) and you will be able to watch & learn from our teammates after due time passes

📌 I will provide detailed feedback on your submissions in private, every other week (and also a grade out of 10)😎

📌Additionally; mentor sample answers will also be revealed after due time passes  (not before due because we do not want you to copy the answer, we want you to research/review the topic and prepare your original answer). I will share the link later on.

➡️ Team, please try to join our group's flip dashboard as soon as possible.
If you have any problems on joining, let me know so that we could try to address before Monday🙏
When you join, you should see our group's dashboard like this

            ☑️Knowledge:Clearly explaining the topic in a well-organized manner.
            ☑️Performance: Demonstrating a confident and enthusiastic demeanor.
            ☑️Appearance: Looking presentable, energetic, and smiling.
            ☑️Behavior: Exhibiting comfort, self-confidence, and expertise.
            ☑️Posture: Ensuring your face and upper body are visible.
            ☑️Lighting: Positioning the light behind the camera for clear visibility. Your face should be seen clearly.
            ☑️Background: Maintaining a tidy background.
            ☑️Recording Quality: Ensuring smooth and uninterrupted recording.
            ☑️Timing: Adhering to time limits and completing before the video ends.
